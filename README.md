Invasion
===================

A very simple game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, to be run in emulators. Written in 6502 assembly language. Created to teach myself about how the NES worked and to learn about lower-level programming.

Click [here](https://github.com/saturn597/invasion/releases/download/v0.1/invasion.nes) to download the ROM for the game. You can play it in an NES emulator like [FCEUX](https://fceux.com/web/home.html), [Nestopia](http://nestopia.sourceforge.net/), or [higan](https://higan.dev/).

Use the control pad to move your ship. Shoot by pressing "B". Hitting a "baddy" causes their ship to disappear.

Assemble and link on a UNIX-like OS by installing the [CC65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65) compiler suite, then running the compile.sh script included in this repository (which references the included configuration file).

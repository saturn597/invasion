Invasion
===================

A very simple game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, to be run in emulators. Written in 6502 assembly language. Created to teach myself about how the NES worked and to learn about lower-level programming.

Assemble and link on a UNIX-like OS by installing the [CC65](https://github.com/cc65/cc65) compiler suite, then running the compile.sh script included in this repository.

Then you'll need an NES emulator like [FCEUX](http://www.fceux.com/web/home.html) to play the file.

Use the control pad to move your ship. Shoot by pressing "B". Hitting a "baddy" causes their ship to disappear.
